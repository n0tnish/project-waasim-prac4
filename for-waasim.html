    <h1>Salaam Waasim. ! </h1>
    <h3><p>You and I are going to take this as slow as possible because I just now realized how differently you and I were taught to code. And that's okay. I promise to be as patient and kind as possible. I'm going to help you as much as I can through this whole thing and InshaaAllah, we'll both end up learning from each other. </p></h3>
